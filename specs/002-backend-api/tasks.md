# Tasks: Backend API

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-backend-api/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Derived User Stories

Based on the technical specification, the following user stories are derived:

**US1 (P1)**: Album Management - Administrators can create, read, update, delete, and reorder albums
**US2 (P2)**: Photo Management - Administrators can upload, view, update metadata, delete, and reorder photos within albums  
**US3 (P3)**: Photo File Operations - System can handle file uploads, generate thumbnails, extract EXIF data, and manage file storage
**US4 (P4)**: API Integration - External systems can access albums and photos via REST API with proper validation and error handling
**US5 (P2)**: Memory Caching - GetList operations for Albums and Photos are cached in memory for improved performance

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 for photo entities and basic operations
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can enhance User Stories 1-3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Depends on User Stories 1 and 2 being implemented for caching their GetList operations

### Within Each User Story

- DTOs and interfaces before implementations
- Validators before service implementations  
- Services before controllers
- Core implementation before authorization and advanced features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1 and 2 can start in parallel
- All DTOs and interfaces within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Testing tasks in Polish phase marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all DTOs for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create AlbumDto in src/PhotoGallery.Application.Contracts/Albums/AlbumDto.cs"
Task: "Create CreateAlbumDto in src/PhotoGallery.Application.Contracts/Albums/CreateAlbumDto.cs"
Task: "Create UpdateAlbumDto in src/PhotoGallery.Application.Contracts/Albums/UpdateAlbumDto.cs"
Task: "Create ReorderAlbumsDto in src/PhotoGallery.Application.Contracts/Albums/ReorderAlbumsDto.cs"
Task: "Create IAlbumAppService interface in src/PhotoGallery.Application.Contracts/Albums/IAlbumAppService.cs"
Task: "Create AlbumDtoValidator in src/PhotoGallery.Application/Albums/AlbumDtoValidator.cs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Album Management)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test album CRUD operations independently
5. Deploy/demo basic album management functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP - Album Management!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Photo Metadata Management)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (File Upload & Processing)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full API Integration)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Performance with Memory Caching)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Album Management)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Photo Management)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (File Operations) - starts after US2 entities are ready
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Follow ABP Framework conventions throughout implementation
- Use FluentValidation instead of data annotations on domain entities
- Implement async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- Verify file paths match project structure from plan.md
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Album management (US1) provides the minimal viable backend API
- File operations (US3) depend on photo entity structure from US2
- Authorization should be implemented consistently across all user stories
- Memory caching (US5) enhances performance of existing GetList operations without changing API contracts
- Cache invalidation should be automatic and transparent to API consumers
