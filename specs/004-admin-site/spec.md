# Feature Specification: Photo Album Organization

Admin site should implemented with React. You can use[free](https://github.com/reactadmins/bootstrap-adminx) template to implement the site for the CRUD UI.

**Feature Branch**: `005-photo-album-management`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by topics (such as Marine time provinces, Europe trip, local community, school activities). Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Album Creation and Management (Priority: P1)

Users can create new photo albums with descriptive names and organize them by topic. Each album serves as a container for related photos without any nesting hierarchy.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other features. Without album creation and basic management, users cannot organize their photos.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new album, giving it a name like "Europe Trip", and verifying it appears on the main page as an empty album ready for photos.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the main page, **When** I click "Create Album", **Then** I can enter an album name and save it
2. **Given** I have created an album, **When** I view the main page, **Then** the new album appears as a card with its name
3. **Given** I have an existing album, **When** I click on its name, **Then** I can edit the album title
4. **Given** I have multiple albums, **When** I delete an album, **Then** it is removed from the main page and all its photos are moved to an "Unorganized" collection

### User Story 2 - Drag and Drop Album Reordering (Priority: P2)

Users can drag and drop albums on the main page to reorganize them according to their personal preferences or workflow needs.

**Why this priority**: This provides the intuitive organization interface that makes the app truly user-friendly and allows personalized workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple albums and verifying that dragging one album to a different position on the main page persists the new order when the page is refreshed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple albums on the main page, **When** I drag an album card to a new position, **Then** the album moves to that position and other albums adjust accordingly
2. **Given** I have reordered my albums, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** the albums maintain their new order
3. **Given** I am dragging an album, **When** I hover over valid drop zones, **Then** visual feedback indicates where the album will be placed

---

### User Story 3 - Photo Upload and Album Assignment (Priority: P3)

Users can upload photos and assign them to specific albums, with the ability to move photos between albums as needed.

**Why this priority**: This enables the core content management functionality but depends on albums existing first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading photos to an existing album and verifying they appear in the album's tile interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an album open, **When** I drag photos from my computer or click "Add Photos", **Then** the photos are uploaded and appear in the album
2. **Given** I have photos in one album, **When** I select photos and choose "Move to Album", **Then** I can move them to a different album
3. **Given** I am uploading multiple photos, **When** the upload is in progress, **Then** I see a progress indicator showing upload status

---

### User Story 4 - Photo Viewing and Navigation (Priority: P4)

Users can view photos within albums using a tile-based interface with options to view individual photos in full size.

**Why this priority**: This completes the basic photo organization experience but is lower priority than the organizational features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening an album with photos and verifying the tile interface displays thumbnails that can be clicked for full-size viewing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have photos in an album, **When** I open the album, **Then** photos are displayed as tiles with thumbnail previews
2. **Given** I am viewing photo tiles, **When** I click on a photo, **Then** it opens in full-size view with navigation controls
3. **Given** I am in full-size view, **When** I use arrow keys or navigation buttons, **Then** I can move between photos in the same album

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users try to upload unsupported file formats?
- How does the system handle very large photo files that exceed size limits?
- What occurs when users attempt to create albums with duplicate names?
- How does the interface behave when users have hundreds of albums?
- What happens when photo uploads fail due to network issues?
- How does the system handle albums with thousands of photos?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new photo albums with custom names
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all albums on a main dashboard page
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to drag and drop albums to reorder them on the main page
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist album order when users refresh or revisit the application
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent nested album creation (albums cannot contain other albums)
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to upload photos to existing albums
- **FR-007**: System MUST display photos within albums using a tile-based grid interface
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to move photos between different albums
- **FR-009**: System MUST support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to delete albums and handle orphaned photos appropriately
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual feedback during drag and drop operations
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to view individual photos in full-size mode from the tile interface

### Key Entities

- **Album**: Represents a collection of photos with a user-defined name, creation date, photo count, and display order
- **Photo**: Represents an uploaded image file with metadata including filename, upload date, file size, dimensions, and album assignment
- **User**: Represents the application user who owns and manages albums and photos

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new album and add their first photo within 60 seconds
- **SC-002**: Album reordering via drag and drop completes in under 2 seconds with smooth visual feedback
- **SC-003**: Photo tile interface loads and displays up to 100 photos within 3 seconds
- **SC-004**: 95% of users successfully complete the basic workflow (create album → upload photo → view photo) on first attempt
- **SC-005**: System maintains album organization and photo assignments across browser sessions without data loss
- **SC-006**: Photo upload progress provides real-time feedback for files up to 10MB
- **SC-007**: Drag and drop operations work consistently across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
