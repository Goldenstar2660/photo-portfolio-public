# Feature Specification: Photo Gallery Public Website

**Feature Branch**: `003-public-site`  
**Created**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a more detailed spec.md for the public site for this project. The public site is the one that users will see, and it is where I will have all of my photos displayed."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Photo Albums (Priority: P1)

Visitors can discover and browse through organized photo collections without requiring any account or login. The website presents photos in an attractive, easy-to-navigate interface that showcases the photographer's work.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the public site - displaying photos to visitors. Without this, the site has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the website, viewing the home page with featured albums, clicking on an album from the navigation menu or home page, and seeing the collection of photos in a tiled layout. Delivers immediate value by allowing visitors to view the photographer's work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the home page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a hero image, personal introduction, and 2-3 featured albums with cover images and descriptions
2. **Given** a visitor is on the home page, **When** they click the "Albums" menu item, **Then** they see a dropdown list of all available albums organized by topic
3. **Given** a visitor selects an album from the dropdown, **When** the album page loads, **Then** they see the album title, description, and all photos displayed in a responsive tiled grid layout
4. **Given** a visitor is viewing an album with multiple photos, **When** they scroll through the page, **Then** photos load efficiently without significant delay
5. **Given** a visitor views an album on a mobile device, **When** the page renders, **Then** the photo grid automatically adjusts to display appropriately for the screen size

---

### User Story 2 - View Photo Details (Priority: P2)

Visitors can interact with individual photos to see them in full size and view metadata such as location and date taken, providing context and appreciation for each photograph.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the browsing experience by allowing visitors to appreciate photos in detail and learn more about each image. Builds on P1 by adding depth to the viewing experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening any album page, hovering over a photo to see location and date metadata, then clicking the photo to view it enlarged in a lightbox/modal. Delivers value by providing detailed viewing and contextual information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is viewing an album, **When** they hover over a photo, **Then** they see the date taken and location (if available) as an overlay
2. **Given** a visitor is viewing an album, **When** they click on a photo, **Then** the photo opens in an enlarged view (lightbox/modal) showing the full-resolution image
3. **Given** a visitor has opened an enlarged photo, **When** viewing the lightbox, **Then** they can see the photo caption, date taken, and location information
4. **Given** a visitor has opened an enlarged photo, **When** they want to view other photos, **Then** they can navigate to the next/previous photo using keyboard arrows or on-screen navigation controls
5. **Given** a visitor has an enlarged photo open, **When** they click outside the image or press the Esc key, **Then** the lightbox closes and returns to the album grid view

---

### User Story 3 - Learn About the Photographer (Priority: P3)

Visitors can access an "About" page to learn about the photographer's background, hobbies, and photography interests, creating a personal connection with the content creator.

**Why this priority**: Adds personality and context to the photo gallery, but the site is still valuable without it. This humanizes the website and can build audience engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking the "About" menu link and viewing a page with the photographer's photo, biography, and interests (biking, photography, etc.). Delivers value by creating personal connection with visitors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is on any page of the site, **When** they click the "About" link in the navigation menu, **Then** they navigate to the About page
2. **Given** a visitor is on the About page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the photographer's profile photo, name, and a biography describing their hobbies including biking and photography
3. **Given** a visitor is reading the About page, **When** viewing the content, **Then** the page layout is visually appealing and matches the overall site design aesthetic

---

### User Story 4 - Navigate Site Efficiently (Priority: P2)

Visitors can easily navigate between different sections of the website using a consistent, always-available navigation menu, ensuring they never feel lost or unable to find content.

**Why this priority**: Good navigation is critical for user experience across all pages. Without it, visitors may struggle to explore the content, but the core functionality (viewing photos) can still work on individual pages.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking through the navigation menu from any page (Home, About, Albums dropdown) and verifying that the menu remains accessible and functional throughout the site. Delivers value by enabling easy site exploration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is on any page of the site, **When** they look at the top of the page, **Then** they see a navigation bar with "Home", "About", and "Albums" menu items
2. **Given** a visitor clicks the "Home" link, **When** the action completes, **Then** they navigate to the home page showing the main hero image and featured albums
3. **Given** a visitor clicks the "Albums" menu item, **When** the menu expands, **Then** they see a dropdown list of all available albums organized by topic
4. **Given** a visitor is viewing the site on a mobile device, **When** they access the navigation, **Then** the menu collapses into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu
5. **Given** a visitor clicks an album name from the dropdown, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** the dropdown closes and they are taken to the selected album page

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an album has no photos? Display the album title and description with a message "No photos in this album yet"
- How does the system handle photos with missing metadata (no location or date)? Display only the available information, gracefully hiding missing fields
- What happens when a photo file fails to load? Display a placeholder image with alt text indicating the photo is unavailable
- How does the site handle very large albums (100+ photos)? Implement pagination or lazy loading to maintain performance, loading additional photos as the user scrolls
- What happens if there are no featured albums selected for the home page? Display the most recently updated albums automatically
- How does the site behave when accessed on very slow internet connections? Show thumbnail images first, with progressive loading for full-resolution images
- What happens when a user tries to navigate directly to an album that doesn't exist? Display a 404 error page with navigation options back to the home page or album list

## Assumptions

1. **Image Storage**: Photos and thumbnails are stored on the server with accessible file paths provided by the backend service
2. **Authentication**: The public site requires no user authentication or login - all content is publicly viewable
3. **Content Management**: Album and photo data is managed through a separate admin interface (out of scope for this spec)
4. **Backend Integration**: The public site directly references and calls backend application services rather than using HTTP API calls for optimal performance
5. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers from the last 2 years (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled
6. **Image Formats**: Photos are provided in web-compatible formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
7. **Thumbnail Generation**: Thumbnails are pre-generated by the backend system and available via thumbnail paths
8. **Featured Albums**: The photographer manually designates which albums appear as "featured" on the home page through the admin interface
9. **Static Content**: About page content and personal information are stored in configuration files or database and can be edited without code deployment
10. **Single Photographer**: The site showcases work from a single photographer (not a multi-user platform)

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly **not** included in this feature:

1. User accounts, registration, or login functionality
2. Social features (comments, likes, sharing to social media)
3. Photo upload or management capabilities (handled by admin site)
4. E-commerce features (purchasing prints, downloads)
5. Contact forms or email integration
6. Search functionality across photos or albums
7. Photo filtering or sorting options
8. EXIF data display (camera settings, GPS coordinates)
9. Integration with third-party photo services (Flickr, Instagram, etc.)
10. Multi-language support or internationalization
11. Analytics or tracking integration
12. Password protection for specific albums
13. Download options for full-resolution photos

## Dependencies

1. **Backend Services**: Photo Gallery Application services for retrieving album and photo data
2. **Bootstrap 5 Template**: Pre-designed template provided in `public-site-template` folder for visual design
3. **Admin Interface**: Separate system for managing albums, photos, and featured content (specified in feature 004-admin-site)
4. **Database**: Photo and album data must be available through backend application services
5. **Hosting Environment**: Web server capable of hosting ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application
6. **Image Storage**: Accessible file storage system for photos and thumbnails

## Technical Constraints

1. **Technology Stack**: Must be built as an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application using .NET 9
2. **UI Framework**: Must use Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework
3. **Direct Service Integration**: Must directly reference backend application services rather than using HTTP APIs
4. **Responsive Design**: Must work on all screen sizes from 320px width to 2560px width
5. **Performance**: Must optimize for fast loading times, targeting sub-3-second page loads
6. **Accessibility**: Should follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines where possible
