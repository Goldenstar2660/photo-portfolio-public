# Tasks: Photo Gallery Public Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-public-site/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-specification.md, quickstart.md

**Implementation Approach**: .NET 9 Razor Pages with direct ABP Application Service integration
**Template Base**: Bootstrap 5 CHEFER template adaptation
**Architecture**: Direct service references for optimal performance (no HTTP layer)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 4 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Enhances navigation from US1
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after US1 complete - Builds on album display
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Core browsing functionality, no dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Navigation enhancement, works with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Recommended after US1 - Builds on album pages with lightbox, independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Completely independent static page

### Within Each User Story

- ViewModels before services (models are independent)
- Services before page models (services provide data)
- Page models before UI implementation
- CSS/JS can be developed in parallel with implementation
- Tests (if added) should be written alongside implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup):**
- T003 (NuGet packages) || T004 (Template assets) || T005 (Folder structure)

**Phase 2 (Foundational):**
- T009 (ViewStart/Imports) || T010 (AutoMapper) || T012 (Navigation partial) || T013 (Error pages) || T014 (PersonalInfoViewModel)

**Phase 3 (User Story 1):**
- T015 (HomeViewModel) || T016 (FeaturedAlbumViewModel) || T017 (RandomPhotoViewModel)
- T023 (AlbumViewModel) || T024 (PhotoViewModel)

**Phase 4 (User Story 4):**
- T038 (Navigation CSS) can run with T037 (Navigation partial enhancement)

**Phase 5 (User Story 2):**
- T044 (PhotoDetailViewModel) can start immediately
- T045-T046 (Metadata overlay) || T047 (Lightbox component)

**Phase 6 (User Story 3):**
- T056 (AboutViewModel) || T057 (HobbyViewModel)

**Phase 7 (Polish):**
- All T065-T085 can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- All T086-T093 (Tests) can run in parallel
- All T094-T098 (Documentation) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T014) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T015-T036) - Browse Photo Albums
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: 
   - Test home page with featured albums
   - Test Albums dropdown navigation
   - Test album page with photo grid
   - Test responsive layout on mobile
5. Deploy/demo MVP if ready

**MVP Delivered**: Visitors can browse home page, navigate to albums, and view photos in grid layout

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Setup + Foundational) ‚Üí T001-T014 complete
2. **MVP** (+ User Story 1) ‚Üí T015-T036 complete
   - Deploy/Demo: Core browsing functionality working
3. **Enhanced Navigation** (+ User Story 4) ‚Üí T037-T043 complete
   - Deploy/Demo: Professional navigation with mobile support
4. **Rich Photo Viewing** (+ User Story 2) ‚Üí T044-T055 complete
   - Deploy/Demo: Lightbox viewing with metadata
5. **Personal Touch** (+ User Story 3) ‚Üí T056-T064 complete
   - Deploy/Demo: Complete public site with About page
6. **Production Ready** (+ Polish) ‚Üí T065-T098 complete
   - Deploy/Demo: Optimized, tested, production-ready site

**Each increment adds value without breaking previous features**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase complete:

**Team Structure A** (3 developers):
- Developer A: User Story 1 (T015-T036) - Core browsing
- Developer B: User Story 3 (T056-T064) - About page (independent)
- Developer C: User Story 4 (T037-T043) - Navigation enhancement

**Team Structure B** (2 developers):
- Developer A: User Story 1 (T015-T036), then User Story 2 (T044-T055)
- Developer B: User Story 3 (T056-T064), then User Story 4 (T037-T043)

**Integration Point**: After all user stories complete, both teams merge and tackle Phase 7 (Polish) together
